## Prerequisites:
 ```
Install Defects4J from https://github.com/rjust/defects4j 
export PATH=$PATH:"path2defects4j"/framework/bin
 ```

 ```
JDK 1.8 for Defects4J
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
export CLASSPATH=.:$JAVA_HOME/lib/dt.jar:$JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar
 ```
 
For python, install the prerequisities with:

   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 
## Building the Java code

##### Check the source code and build the package as below.

 ```
cd perturbation_model
mvn package assembly:single
```
Please check perturbation-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar under perturbation_model/target folder.
Simplely check it with the different options:
```
java -jar perturbation-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar path Options=SelfAPR|BugLab|test

With option SelfAPR: we perturb with all 16 rules in SelfAPR (Then the perturbation-based samples are executed).
With option BugLab: we perturb with all 16 rules in BugLab (No execution will be conducted).
With option test: we extract context information for testing samples.

```

##### We also uploaded a jar package on Zenodo. Download the jar file and execute it as below.
```
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6582348
java -jar ./perturbation_model/target/perturbation-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar Your/JAVA/FILE/PATH Options=SelfAPR|BugLab|test-'buggyLineNo'
```



##  Code perturbation scripts

#### Checkout the buggy projects, apply the human written patches on them and make sure NO failling tests. Start the perturbation with this script:
```
python3  1_perturb_projects.py
```
#### Iterate each file of the considered projects, generate perturbed project-specific trianings samples and execute them against test cases:
```
python3  2_execute_perturbation.py
```
#### Prepare a set of evaluation bugs from Defects4J:

```
python3 3_prepare_test_data.py
```

#### We are ready to train the perturbed samples with transformer:Pytorch==1.7.1 and transformers>=4.10.0
```
pip install transformers
pip install sentencepiece
python3 4_train.py
```

#### To test the trained model:
```
python3 5_test.py
```

#### To evaluat the test results:
```
python3 6_evaluate_patch.py
```

## Fault Localization with Gzoltar and Flacoco: faultlocalization 


#### We compute all the suspicous buggy lines with two fault localization with Gzoltar and Flacoco. At inference phase, for a given suspicious statement found by fault localization tools, SelfAPR represents it with a sequences of tokens. Those tokens are given to the trained SelfAPR model. SelfAPR is configured by the inference beam size n, it outputs  the n best patches for that suspicious statement.
